COLLECTION POLICY
Mission
Scholar@UC is a digital repository that serves the needs of the University of Cincinnati (UC). The mission of Scholar@UC is to preserve the intellectual output of UC, to advance discovery and innovation, to foster scholarship and learning through the transformation of data into knowledge, to collect a corpus of works that can be used for teaching and to inspire derivative works, and to enhance discoverability and access to these resources.
Content
Scholar@UC was developed to store the scholarly output and creative works of UC faculty (current and emeritus), staff, and students. Original research outputs and creative works of the University community, born-digital University records, and digitized special collections of UC Libraries will be preserved and made available. Works that are deposited in Scholar@UC should support the mission of the University of Cincinnati. Those interested in depositing UC records should contact Records Management <http://www.libraries.uc.edu/arb/records-management.html>.
Examples of appropriate content include, but are not limited to: grey literature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature>; pre- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint>, post- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postprint>, and published versions of academic papers; manuscripts; senior design projects; theses; dissertations; posters; datasets; presentations; and other creative works. Content may be text, image, video, audio, or mixed-media in nature.
