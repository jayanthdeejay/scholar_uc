Proxy accounts in Scholar@UC work very similar to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/138350?hl=en\">delegate accounts in Gmail</a>. If you authorize a proxy they can view, edit, or delete all of your existing works and files. Proxies can also create new works and upload files on your behalf. The proxy relationship can be revoked by the owner at any time. Use work-specific editors for more fine-grained access control."
